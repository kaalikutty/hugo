### COVID-19

```
4 months, Its been 4months, living my life Scared of you...
You wiped out many lives from this world
You pulled down many lives in this world
Every call from my parents makes me nervous

Every day thinking about you, that one day you will grab me too with your hands
Many beautiful lives give up without even saying a bye to their loved ones.
They give up without even seeing their kids...
They give up without even seeing their home...
They give up without even living their life...
Still, you are not happy.

I started forgetting the days I have gone outside
I started forgetting seeing me dressed up for work
I started forgetting seeing me feeling the fresh air
I started forgetting seeing me living my life without fear...
Still, you are not happy.

Every day is a hope that you leave us for ever.. but...
Now I need pain killers to sleep
Every day ...Almost every day...
I eat my pain on the bed...because I am locked...
I couldn't breathe many nights...My tears are not coming out...because I eat my pain on the bed...
I can't go out because you are there outside, because I know one day you will grab my hands too...

What more you need?
You are free ...You can fly anywhere ...You can grab anyone with a dead
You are the only one who is happy in this world

Go away from our lives ...Please go away...
Let us live our remaining days in this beautiful world...
Please go away...

```
