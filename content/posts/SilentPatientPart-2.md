I didn't have any idea even after reading about Alcestis. What could be the reason when a woman decided to be silent? Many !.Because a woman is a mystery. She remains silent for many reasons. She might be destroyed inside or she might be waiting to explode or she might be.....who can explain. Nobody!

She surrenders her life to her husband. She was an ideal of how women love her husband. But still why she chooses to not speak? I asked this question to me many times until Paul disclose what happened on that night of her mother's accident. Yes, it was Alicia's father who killed her alive. He damaged her childhood. She was alone, helpless. But how it connected to Gabriel's assassination? Was she really a psycho? No, she was not. Many believed so. But she was not.

She wanted help. She wanted people to believe her. At least Gabriel , her love of life. She was Scared.
All night she stayed near the window to check up on the STRANGER. Wait !there comes this stranger to make her life horrible. I don't know if its a coincidence every book I read there is a stranger.
Who was that Max?Paul?Jean? Maybe none of them, but then who is the stranger? who followed Alicia everywhere. She started feeling unprotected by everyone. She started preparing herself to defend the stranger at any time. And it happens one day as she expected. The image which she was unable to describe to anyone , she saw the reflection of him in the window. What was my feeling at that time? When I realized who is the stranger. More than that what worries me is the moment I realized about the Betrayal that hit Alicia.The worst feeling in the world.

Tell me, Gabriel: Let's find out how much you love her? Ok, here its time for you to link what Alicia overheard her father on the day her mother died and the way STRANGER choose to prove Gabriel's love for Alicia. And that's it. Now the dots are connected. Everything is crystal clear. Now I know the answer to everything. What damaged Alicia? Who was the Stranger? Who killed Gabriel? Everything is transparent.

Such a brilliant way of connecting the gaps, Alex Michaelides(The Silent Patient)
