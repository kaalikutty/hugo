Lima, the capital of Peru. When I first told my Mom about my onsite travel plan to Peru, she was frightened. For her, its a country where people get kidnapped, robbed, murdered and I know its no one but my brother scared her. First foreign trip, it was a dream from childhood to explore many places. But of course, being a woman, the world has a lot of restrictions defined. Finally, the day came Oct 13 -2018 and I flew to Lima. First international travel. Bangalore to Amsterdam, Amsterdam to Lima. San Isidro district that's where my office locates.

### Bosque el Olivar

Such a beautiful park, a pond which is surrounded by trees and flowers,  olive trees everywhere, small square benches, cycling lots it's just a few minute's walk from my hotel. And that is the place which I always loved to go. 

Kids were playing around, some doing exercise, some were busy in cycling, few were having food and keep on talking to their friends and family, Some corners were busy with wedding photo shoots. It was awesome seeing all those scenes. The park that taught me to get a balance on an electric scooterðŸ›´.

### Casa de la Cultura

A yellow building in the middle of the beautiful Olivar Park. Many cultural activities happen there. That pretty gallery, I slowly walked to see all, some were looking so real. I spend many hours exploring that big park, neat, fresh air, positive vibes everywhere ...

Peru is so famous for its cuisine. Pollo la Brasa, Oh God my favorite dish. I tried a lot of yummy dishes, Lomo Saltado, Ceviche, Variety of potatoes dipped into the spicy sauce and it goes like that. Trust me I write this with a watery mouth. Thanks, Peru such warm welcome you give me. My first weekend ...
